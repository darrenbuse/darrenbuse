## Hey 👋, I'm Darren

**Engineering Director** • London, UK &nbsp; [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0A66C2?style=flat&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenbuse/)

Engineering leader who still loves getting hands dirty. I build happy, effective teams. Built and led teams at **Board Intelligence** and launched **Lucia**. Now exploring how AI can make engineering teams (and my own workflow) more effective.

```clojure
;; "I used to write Java for money. Now I write Clojure for fun."
;; My therapist says this is progress.
```

🔭 **Currently:** Automating my job with AI so I can focus on more important side projects

🌱 **Philosophy:** Work across the stack learning as you go, make friends everywhere, take nothing seriously

💬 **Ask me about:** Clojure, engineering leadership, or why I have 47 unfinished side projects

✈️ **Otherwise:** Travelling or 🔨 building something at home
