🔭 Currently: Automating my job with AI so I can focus on more important side projects

🌱 Philosophy: Work across the stack learning as you go, make friends everywhere, take nothing seriously

💬 Ask me about: Clojure, leadership, or why I have 47 unfinished side projects

*Yes, I'm a director who still codes. No, I won't stop.*
