```clojure
;; "I used to write Java for money. Now I write Clojure for fun."
;; My therapist says this is progress.
```

🔭 Currently: Automating my job with AI so I can focus on more important side projects
<br><br>
🌱 Philosophy: Work across the stack learning as you go, make friends everywhere, take nothing seriously
<br><br>
💬 Ask me about: Clojure, leadership, or why I have 47 unfinished side projects
<br><br>
✈️ Otherwise: Travelling or 🔨 building something at home

*Yes, I'm a director who still codes. No, I won't stop.*
